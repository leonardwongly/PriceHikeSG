# PriceHikeSG

## Description
PriceHikeSG is a web application designed to provide updates on upcoming price hikes in Singapore. <br/>
It's a very simple HTML web page to track price hikes in Singapore. <br/>
I created it because I find it hard to keep track of all the price hikes that are coming in Singapore. <br/>
I do <b>NOT</b> intend to add too much features to it, but I will try to keep it updated as much as possible.<br>
